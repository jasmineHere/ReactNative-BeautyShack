  <h2> Description </h2>
  <p>We are a team of seven members and all of us have collaborated to start working on an app idea BeautyShack. BeautyShack will be an application that will list multiple salons for a customer, so that he or she can select any one salon and further book appointment for any services they want to avail according to the selected time slot of their own choice. So, any customer can decide while using their mobile phones when they want a haircut, facial or some special skin care treatment and can book an appointment using our app for the same, so even in this case they have to pay a visit but they will be prepared in advance that they have to go to the salon on some particular date and time and above that they would know they will be pampered by a hair-dresser or beautician or etc., whenever they step into the salon at the scheduled time. Using our app idea, the reachability of customers to business and business to the customer would become a lot easier.</p>
